# recipe-app

This application allows the user to add recipes to the page and delete them if no longer needed. I used JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS to create the application with heavy utilization of state in React to make sure the page renders correctly. 

This was definitely a good stretch for me to use state in React and make sure my components all work together correctly. 

If you would like to run this file on your computer:

  3) then run 'npm start' to start your local server
  4) this should open a new window for you to review the application
